## Code Structure

The application consists of two main parts:

1. **UI**: Defined in `rockbox_listenbrainz_scrobbler/ui.py`. It uses PySide6 to build a graphical interface that allows users to interact with the application.
2. **Scrobbling**: Located in `rockbox_listenbrainz_scrobbler/scrobbling.py`. It contains functions responsible for reading the log file, validating the user token, and communicating with the ListenBrainz API to submit the listening data.
